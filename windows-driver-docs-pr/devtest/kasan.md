# Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN)

The Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) is a bug detection technology supported on Windows kernel drivers that enables you to detect several classes of illegal memory accesses, such as buffer overflows and use-after-free events. It requires you to enable KASAN on your system, and recompile your kernel driver with a specific MSVC compiler flag.

## Pre-requisites

In order to use KASAN, you need:

 - OS version of the target system, on which your kernel driver will be loaded:
    - Client: Windows 11 24H2 or above.
    - Server: Windows Server 2025 or above.
 - VisualStudio: version 17.11 or above.
 - WDK: version 10.0.26100.2161 or above.

KASAN is supported only on x64.

## How to enable KASAN on your kernel driver

1. Enter the following command line in an administrator **Command Prompt** window on the target system:

   ```console
   reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Kernel" /v KasanEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1
   ```

1. Reboot your target system for the change to take effect.

1. Recompile your kernel driver with KASAN instrumentation enabled by passing a new flag to the MSVC compiler. Use either of the following methods:

    - **GUI**: in VisualStudio, navigate to the **Solution Explorer**, right-click on your kernel driver project, and select **Properties**. In the property page, navigate to **Configuration Properties** >> **C/C++** >> **General**, and set **Enable Kernel Address Sanitizer** to *Yes*. Then rebuild your solution.
    - **Command prompt**: add the */fsanitize=kernel-address* parameter to your compiler command line. Then, rebuild your solution.

1. Load your recompiled kernel driver on your target system, and stress-test it as you usually would. KASAN operates at runtime and reports illegal memory access events via **Bug Check 0x1F2: KASAN_ILLEGAL_ACCESS**.

## How to verify that KASAN is enabled on your kernel driver

The kernel drivers compiled with KASAN have a PE section called "`KASAN`". Verify that KASAN is enabled on your driver by running the following command in a **Developer Command Prompt**:

```console
dumpbin /ALL YourDriver.sys
```

If the output contains a section called "`KASAN`", then KASAN is enabled on your driver.

## How to analyze KASAN reports

When KASAN detects an illegal memory access in your driver, it issues **Bug Check 0x1F2: KASAN_ILLEGAL_ACCESS**. Inspect the generated kernel memory dump to determine where exactly your driver performed an illegal memory access.

Use KASAN with a kernel debugger attached to the target system so that the memory can be inspected dynamically as soon as the bug check is issued, rather than post-mortem with a memory dump.

### Bug check parameters

The parameters of **Bug Check 0x1F2: KASAN_ILLEGAL_ACCESS** are:

 1. Parameter 1: Address being accessed illegally.
 1. Parameter 2: Size of the memory access.
 1. Parameter 3: Address of the caller performing the illegal memory access.
 1. Parameter 4: Extra information on the memory access:
     - Bits [0:7]: the KASAN shadow code. See the table below.
     - Bit 8: `1` if the access was a write, `0` if it was a read.

### KASAN shadow codes

In KASAN, we consider that all of the kernel memory is divided in contiguous chunks of eight-byte-aligned, eight-byte *cells*. With KASAN, each eight-byte cell in kernel memory has a *shadow code* associated with it, which is an one-byte integer that indicates the validity of the cell. The encoding of the shadow codes is the following:

| Value | Meaning |
|--|--|
| `0x00` | The cell is entirely valid: accesses to all eight bytes of the cell are legal. |
| `0x01` -> `0x07` | The cell is partially valid: the first *value* bytes in the cell are valid, but the rest are invalid. |
| >= `0x80` | The cell is entirely invalid: accesses to all eight bytes of the cell are illegal. |

Several sub-codes are used for the entirely invalid cells to further indicate what type of memory the cell is associated to, and why it is invalid:

 - `0x81`: left redzone of alloca.
 - `0x82`: middle redzone of alloca.
 - `0x83`: right redzone of alloca.
 - `0x84`: right redzone of global variable.
 - `0x85`: generic redzone.
 - `0x86`: right redzone of pool memory.
 - `0x87`: freed memory.
 - `0x8A`: left redzone of contiguous memory.
 - `0x8B`: right redzone of contiguous memory.
 - `0x8C`: freed lookasidelist memory.
 - `0x8D`: left redzone of pool memory.
 - `0xF1`: left redzone of stack variable.
 - `0xF2`: middle redzone of stack variable.
 - `0xF3`: right redzone of stack variable.
 - `0xF5`: used-after-ret stack variable.
 - `0xF8`: out-of-scope stack variable.

### Understand KASAN bug checks: an example

Assume that KASAN issued a bug check when your driver was executing, with these parameters:

 1. Parameter 1: `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFABCD`
 1. Parameter 2: `0x0000000000000004`
 1. Parameter 3: `0xFFFFFFFF12345678`
 1. Parameter 4: `0x0000000000000184`

*Parameter 1* tells you that your driver tried to access address `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFABCD` and that this access was illegal. *Parameter 2* tells you that it was a four-byte access. *Parameter 3* gives you the address of the instruction pointer at which your driver performed the illegal access. *Parameter 4* tells you that this was a write access, and that the memory being touched was the right redzone of a global variable.

In other words, your driver likely tried to perform a write buffer overflow on a global variable. Use this information to investigate and determine where and how to fix this bug in your driver.

## Performance impact of KASAN

KASAN increases kernel memory consumption and introduces an approximate two-times slowdown in drivers compiled with KASAN enabled.

## Comparison with Driver Verifier

KASAN and Driver Verifier are entirely separate features, but are mutually compatible.

KASAN is focused on detecting illegal memory accesses, and is more efficient than Driver Verifier in that domain, because it uses a more fine-grained approach and covers more memory regions. Driver Verifier on the other side has driver-specific rules that aim at finding other types of bugs, that KASAN does not detect.

Use KASAN in conjunction with Driver Verifier to maximize the detection of bugs in your driver.
