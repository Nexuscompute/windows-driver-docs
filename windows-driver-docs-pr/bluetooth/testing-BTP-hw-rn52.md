# RN52 device

## Overview

The RN52 is a Bluetooth basic rate (BR) radio from Roving Networks capable of behaving as an audio peripheral, such as a speaker or headset. To aid with validation, this sled routes the audio out data from the radio to an audio codec and audio processing field-programmable gate array (FPGA) on the Traduci. For more information, see the [MicroChip RN52](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/RN52) web page.
