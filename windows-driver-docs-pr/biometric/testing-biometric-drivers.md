# Testing Biometric Drivers

Microsoft recommends that all drivers, including biometric drivers, be tested for quality and reliability. To test your driver, run the static analysis tools in the WDK. For more information, see [Analyzing Driver Quality by Using Code Analysis Tools](/windows-hardware/drivers).

Als, you can use the runtime tools, such as the [WDF Verifier Control Application](../devtest/wdf-verifier-control-application.md) and [Application Verifier](../devtest/application-verifier.md).

To test Windows Biometric Framework driver packages, download the [Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=733613) for tools.
