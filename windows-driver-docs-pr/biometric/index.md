# Biometric Devices Design Guide Documentation

This section describes how to write user-mode drivers that work with the Windows Biometric Driver Interface (WBDI). WBDI is the driver interface of the Windows Biometric Framework (WBF). WBF ships with Windows 7 and later versions of the Windows operating system.

> [!CAUTION]
>While WudfBioUsbSample no longer ships as part of the WDK, the WBDI interface demonstrated by this sample and documented here is still the recommended way to write biometric drivers.
>You can still find the sample in previous releases of the Windows driver samples repo, for example [Windows 11, version 22H2 - May 2022 Driver Samples Update](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/releases/tag/win11-22h2).

## Getting Started

To get started with writing biometric drivers, see the following topics:

- [Getting Started with Biometric Drivers](getting-started-with-biometric-drivers.md)
- [Roadmap for Developing Biometric Drivers](roadmap-for-developing-biometric-drivers.md)
- [Sample Biometric Driver](sample-biometric-driver.md)
