# Remote Debugging

Remote user-mode debugging involves two computers: the *client* and the *server*. The server is the computer that runs the application to be debugged. The server also runs the user-mode debugger or a process server. The client is the computer that remotely controls the debugging session.

Remote kernel-mode debugging involves three computers: the *client*, the *server*, and the *target computer*. The target computer is the computer to be debugged. The server is a computer that runs the kernel debugger or a KD connection server. The client is the computer that remotely controls the debugging session.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are important security considerations when using remote debugging. For more information, including information on enabling secure mode, see [Security During Remote Debugging](security-during-remote-debugging.md) and [Security Considerations for Windows Debugging Tools](security-considerations.md).
