# Secure Mode

When you are performing kernel-mode debugging, you can run the debugger in *Secure Mode*. This helps to prevent the debugger from affecting the host computer, yet does not significantly decrease its freedom to debug the target computer.

Secure Mode is recommended if you are going to allow remote clients to join your debugging session.
